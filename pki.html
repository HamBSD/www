HamPKI
</h2>
<hr>
<p>To build robust and resilient amateur packet networks, they need to be able
to resist attack. As with other systems with poor or non-existent
authentication, over time the probability that they will be attacked approaches
certainty.
<p>We have seen this happen again and again, and in some cases it has
removed applications from existence.
Example range from guestbooks on personal websites <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamdexing#Link_spam">filled with spam</a>
to attacks on communications signalling systems (e.g. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BGP_hijacking">BGP</a>, <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/19/ss7-hack-explained-mobile-phone-vulnerability-snooping-texts-calls">SS7</a>).
Another recent example is the <a
href="https://dkg.fifthhorseman.net/blog/openpgp-certificate-flooding.html">certificate
flooding attacks</a> on OpenPGP key servers.
Personal guestbooks and the OpenPGP key servers have drifted into the past,
replaced by comments sections authenticated by Facebook accounts and new <a
href="https://wiki.gnupg.org/WKD">key distribution systems</a>.
Even where applications have survived, they are no longer as easy to use.
<p>HamPKI aims to prevent amateur radio services from falling to the same fate
by providing a framework for authenticating radio amateurs using packet radio
systems.
<h3>Root Certificate Bundle</h3>
<p>HamBSD includes an additional CA bundle found at
<code>/etc/hamcert.pem</code>. This bundle can be used to authenticate servers
and clients as licensed radio amateurs. Callsigns are found in issued
certificates as <code>OID.1.3.6.1.4.1.12348.1.1</code>.

</ul>
<h3>Future Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Produce a policy for inclusion of new root certificates</li>
<li>Produce a toolkit for operating a CA</li>
</ul>
