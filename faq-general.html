<p>
Hopefully not. It would be great to be able to upstream this work into OpenBSD
at some point in the future. Patches that fix or enhance existing OpenBSD
functionality will be submitted upstream.

<p>
During development however, technical preview releases may be produced for
amateur radio operators (and others interested) to try out.

for IPIP tunnels or an ampr-ripd port?</a></h2>

<p>
Centralisation is not a goal of this project. In order to provide robust and
resilient infrastructure, we need decentralised systems where operators actually
talk to each other to set up links. When traffic is coming in from the Internet,
it would be great if that traffic were also authenticated in some way. (The
source IP address is <em>not</em> a form of authentication.)
