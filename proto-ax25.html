<p><a title="AX.25 Link Access Protocol for Amateur Packet Radio"
href="https://www.tapr.org/pdf/AX25.2.2.pdf">AX.25</a> is a link-layer protocol
used with amateur packet radio. As AX.25 uses encoded amateur radio callsigns
for addressing, it meets the requirements for amateur radio transmissions
to be easily identified. It is common to use a Terminal Node Controller (TNC)
to connect a computer to an AX.25 network.

<h3>KISS</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ka9q.net/papers/kiss.html">KISS TNC protocol</a>
provides a framing protocol for use over a serial line to communicate with a
TNC to send and receive packets via a radio link.

<p>Frames look like:

<p>The FEND (frame end) at the start and end of the frame signifies the
boundaries of the frame. This allows the TNC to know when one frame has
finished and another has begun. The first byte of the frame is split into two
nibbles (4 bit fields). The first of these indicates the "port" number, for
systems with multiple radios attached. The second nibble is a command.
The most common command is 0, meaning data. Following this first byte are the
bytes of data to be transmitted. The same occurs in the other direction, with
the TNC sending data in the same framing to the host.

<p>When a FEND occurs inside the data to be transmitted, it must
be escaped in order to not be misinterpreted as the end of a frame. This
uses a FESC (frame escape) byte which must also be escaped. The FEND code is
then sent as FESC, TFEND (transposed frame end) and the FESC is then sent as
FESC, TFESC (transposed frame escape).

<p>See the <a href="faq-tnc.html">KISS TNC FAQ Entry</a> for more information
on using KISS TNCs with HamBSD.

<h3>AX.25 Link Layer</h3>

<p>As a link layer protocol, AX.25 allows for communication between hosts on
the same link. In this case, that means those in the same radio channel. A
channel will be defined by at least the frequency, mode, directionality,
antenna height, antenna gain and power. Unlike some other link layers, not all
hosts that are able to communicate with one host will be able to communicate
with each other.

<p>AX.25 has support for "source routing" where the sender may specify stations
that should forward frames. These forwarders are known as digipeaters
(<strong>digi</strong>tal re<strong>peaters</strong>). The original
specification allowed up to 8 digipeaters, while later revisions limit this
number to 2. It was the intention of the specification authors that once layer
3 (network layer) protocols were deployed that this layer 2 forwarding would
no longer be required.

<p>The specification included both a "connected mode" and also a simpler
mode for sending datagrams. The connected mode uses a collection of frame types
while the datagram mode uses only one type: "Unnumbered Information" (UI)
frames.

<p>HamBSD aims to support the use of AX.25 UI frames for use with <a
href="proto-aprs.html">APRS</a> and <a href="proto-tcpip.html">TCP/IP</a>. It
does not support the use of connected mode AX.25.

<p>A UI frame looks like:

<img src="packets/ax25.svg" alt="Bit Field Diagram for AX.25 Header" style="max-width: 1000px;">

<p>The first two addresses, destination and source, are mandatory. Then there
may be up to 8 "via" addresses. Each address consists of at most a 6 charachter
callsign and a secondary station identifier from 0 to 15. The last bit of each
address (excluding the destination address) may be set to 1 to indicate the
end of the addresses field. If there are no digipeaters specified, this means
that the source address will have this bit set (shown as "L" in the above
diagram).

<p>Following the addresses there are two fields: control
and PID. The control field will always be 0x03 to
indicate that this is a UI frame. The PID will be 0xF0 for APRS, 0xCC for
TCP/IP or 0xCD for Address Resolution Protocol (ARP, required for TCP/IP).

<p>To learn more about APRS, see the <a href="proto-aprs.html">APRS protocol
page</a>, or see the <a href="faq-aprs.html">APRS FAQ Entry</a> for information
on using APRS with HamBSD. To learn more about TCP/IP, see the <a
href="proto-aprs.html">TCP/IP protocol page</a>.
