<h3>Usage Instructions</h3>

<p>When in range of MB7UAR, send APRS packets on 144.800MHz. All packets will
be relayed to APRS-IS.</p>

<p>If a position report is sent, it will be possible to establish two-way
messaging between your RF station and either an Internet station or another
RF station linked via another IGate.</p>

<p>To enable RF-to-RF communication locally, MB7UAR may be used as a digipeater.
It will digipeat packets according to the "new n-N Paradigm". In practice, this
means that you should set your path to include at least "WIDE2-1" or at most
"WIDE1-1,WIDE2-1".</p>

<h3>Coverage</h3>
<p>The following map was calculated with some perhaps over-optimistic
assumptions. It is probably more representative for fixed stations than
mobiles, and for handhelds you may struggle. YMMV.</p>
<p>At the time the antenna was installed, the local noise floor was recorded at
around S6.</p>

Report".</p>

<h3>Station Details</h3>

<h4>Controller</h4>

<p>While HamBSD matures, this station is currently controlled by a Raspberry Pi
running Dire Wolf on Raspbian. The following configuration is used:</p>

<h4>Transceiver</h4>

<p>MB7UAR uses a Yaesu FT-1900 as its transciever. The radio is connected via
a soundcard interface cable connected to its microphone and external speaker
ports. This radio does not have the 5-pin mini-DIN data port that is common
on Yaesu radios.</p>

<p>The transmitter power output is set to 5 watts and uses a "narrow" channel.
The mic gain setting (menu item 27) has been used to set the peak deviation to
2.5kHz.</p>

<h4>Antenna and Feeder</h4>

<p>A simple dipole is installed in the attic. The bracket, suppport and
elements are made from aluminium.</p>
<p>10 meters of RG58 coax is used to connect the antenna and the radio with
PL259 connecters at both ends.</p>
<p>The reading of SWR from the Yaesu FT-817 is not an accurate reading, but
suggests that the SWR is probably somewhere between 1:1 and 1.5:1. The FT-817
does not actually measure SWR but instead only measures reflected power. This
reading was taken using 5W output.</p>

<h4>Internet Gateway</h4>
<p>This IGate has a redundant connection to the Internet, using fixed VDSL and
failover to an LTE connection. It uses the APRS2 European round-robin to select
the server to connect to.
