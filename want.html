Hardware Wanted
</h2>
<hr>

<p>
The following list outlines hardware that the HamBSD project could use.
There are a number of reasons why developers need hardware, and it is important
to first of all realize these reasons:

<ul>
<li>To support a specific device, normally one which is more rare or new.
<li>To be part of their development environment.
<li>Some of these devices may have quirks that require some
    investigation and workaround in order to function correctly.
<li>That said, space or power may be at a premium for some people.
</ul>

<p>
If you do not own these devices, but want to help us, we recommend you
search on <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk">eBay</a> for the devices.  If
you do the bidding and then get the device shipped to us, it really
helps us. It is better if developers develop, and skip the bidding process,
since any time saved can be spent on improving HamBSD instead.

<p>
Some items are available in kit form. If you are happy to build and test the
kit before shipping it on to a developer, that can save some money and provide
a fun project too. If you enjoy building kits but don't enjoy them sitting
around unused afterwards, we can almost certainly come to an arrangement.

<p>
Contact <a href="mailto:irl@hambsd.org">Iain Learmonth</a>
who will be able to tell you if something is useful, and if so, where to
send it.

<p>
Please be very clear as to where you are located!! Unless an item is
particularly rare, it is probably uneconomical to ship from anywhere outside
Europe. (All development currently happens in <em>Scotland</em>.)

<h3>General Requirements</h3>
<p>

<ul>
<li>Terminal Node Controllers (RS232 or USB)</li>
<li>Transcievers with built-in TNC (e.g. Kenwood TM-D700, TM-D710, TH-D72,
  TH-D74)</li>
<li>All-mode transcievers (e.g. FT-897, FT-857 and Icom 706)</li>
<li>RS232 protocol analyser</li>
</ul>

<h3>TNC-X</h3>
<p>
It looks like the <a
href="https://mfjenterprises.com/products/mfj-1270x">TNC-X</a> is quite popular
and is readily available to purchase. It would be great to have one of these
available for development in <em>Scotland</em>. If purchasing this new, it
would be the "Complete Wired and Tested TNC-X including USB and Enclosure"
option that is preferred to allow testing of both the serial port connection
and USB connection. Additionally, the "<a
href="https://mfjenterprises.com/products/mfj-5060">5 Pin DIN to 6 Pin Mini-DIN
TNC/Radio Cable</a>" would be required.

<hr>
<h3>Dummy Loads</h3>
<p>
A couple dummy loads would be useful for supporting development and testing in
<em>Scotland</em>. They should have either SO-239 sockets, or for units
intended to plug directly onto the antenna socket, PL-259 plugs. A power rating
of 10-15W is entirely sufficient.
